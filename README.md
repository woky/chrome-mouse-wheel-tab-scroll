Chrome Mouse Wheel Tab Scroll
=============================

*Scroll tabs with modifier (shift key or right mouse button) and mouse wheel.*

Hold shift key or right mouse button and scroll mouse wheel to scroll through
tabs. Scrolling with right mouse button doesn't work with GTK+ version (Linux)
because it shows context-menu on mouse press and changing it to mouse release
would break user experience.

It doesn't work with <code>chrome://...</code> and
<code>chrome-extension://...</code> URLs (like PDF.js tabs), i.e. if you scroll
on such tab you won't be able to scroll away from it.
